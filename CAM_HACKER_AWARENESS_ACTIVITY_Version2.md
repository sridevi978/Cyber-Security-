## RESULT

- **Use a Physical Cover:** The most effective defense is a physical webcam slide/cover or a piece of opaque tape.
- **Keep OS & Software Updated:** Patching the operating system and all applications regularly closes security holes that hackers exploit.
- **Use Reputable Antivirus/EDR:** Employ strong, active security software to detect and block malicious RATs.
- **Monitor Running Processes:** Use Task Manager or Activity Monitor to periodically check for unfamiliar, suspicious processes with network activity.
- **Check App Permissions:** Review which applications have access to your camera and microphone in your system's privacy settings and revoke access for any unnecessary apps.
